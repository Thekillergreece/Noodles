Introduces noodles and soy ramen food items into the game.

If you are considering to download and install this noodles food pack, I strongly recommend you download and install my other food pack mod and Waltz's food pack as well.

### Installation
---
- If you haven't done so already, install MelonLoader by downloading and running MelonLoader.Installer.exe
- Install the latest version of ModComponent and its dependencies.
- Download latest version of Noodles from the releases page.
- Move NoodlesByTKG.modcomponent to your mods folder.
- (OPTIONAL) Download latest version of Foods by 'Calorie Waltz' from their releases page as well as FoodPackByTKG.
- (OPTIONAL) Move the mod's contents to mods folder.

### Help needed
---
I'm looking for folks who know how to model, create textures for models, anything about Unity for future food-related items.
